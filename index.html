          <strong>Connect Four AI </strong><br>
          <span>For a project in Class we had to create an AI that could play Connect Four. This process included training the AI to look at the board and understand the game mechanics along with strategies for winning. For this specific AI we awarded more points for pieces placed towards the center of the board, which increased the win rate significantly.</span>
